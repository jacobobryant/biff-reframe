# How to use re-frame with Biff

This is an example of using re-frame instead of htmx with [Biff](https://biffweb.com). See [How to use re-frame with
Biff](https://biffweb.com/p/how-to-use-reframe-with-biff/) for commentary. To try it out:

1. Run `bb generate-secrets` and save the values to `secrets.env`.
2. Run `bb dev` like usual.
